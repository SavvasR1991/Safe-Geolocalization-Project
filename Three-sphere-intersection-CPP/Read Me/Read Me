This is a c++ program to calculate an unkwown node coordinate D(x,y,z) from the top of a triagular pyramid. 

(A) The inputs are:
    1. The coordinates of the base of the pyramid
            a.A(xa,ya,za)
            b.B(xb,yb,zb)
            c.C(xc,yc,zc)
    2.The vector length of the point D to the other points.
            a.|AD|
            b.|BD|
            c.|CD|
    
    The inputs are readen from the Folder Tests. The coordinates of D are given so the vector lengths are calculated and also for the output of the algorithm to be compared with the actuall coordinates of the unknown node D.
    
(B) The outputs are written to the folder Results.There is also explanation of the code execution in the console outputs.

(C) To run this project:
    1.Open a terminal in the folder: Node Localization
    2.Run command ./Run
    3.For clean up run command ./Run clean
    
    
(D) Example:
    1.Input:
        a.A = -3 -3 0
        b.B = 0 0 0
        c.C = -3 3 0
        d.D = 0 0 5
        
    2.Execution:
        a.|AD| =  6.55744 is calculated
        b.|BD| =  5       is calculated
        c.|CD| =  6.55744 is calculated
        d. D'  = [-1.18424e-15 , 0 , 5] is calculated
        e. D' is rounding with epsilon = 0.000001 
           D'  = rounding([-1.18424e-15 , 0 , 5]) = [0 0 5] 
        f.Compare D' with D
        
     3.Output:
        The Base of the Triangular Pyramid of Shape 3 is :
        A = [ -3 , -3 , 0]
        B = [ 0 , 0 , 0]
        C = [ -3 , 3 , 0]
        The unknown Node has    D  = [ 0 , 0 , 5]
        The length of A,D is  |AD| = [ 6.55744]
        The length of B,D is  |BD| = [ 5]
        The length of C,D is  |CD| = [ 6.55744]
        The algorithm calcuted: D' = [ -1.18424e-15 , 0 , 5]

(E) You can see the pyramids real shapes in the Folder Shapes
